5 Installing Sonarqube
For historical downloads Refer Here
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.9.3.79811.zip
apt install unzip -y
unzip sonarqube-9.9.3.79811.zip
mv sonarqube-9.9.3.79811 sonarqube-9.9
Sonar will not be executed with root user
We need to create a user called as sonar and start the applicaiton with that user
useradd sonar

#visudo
sonar           ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
chown -R sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube-9.9
chmod -R 775 /opt/sonarqube-9.9

# Switch user to sonar
su - sonar
cd /opt/sonarqube-9.9
cd bin
cd linux-x86-64/
sh sonar.sh start

# To Verify status of sonarqube
sh sonar.sh status
Once the installation is successful, sonarqube can be acessible at port 9000
Make sure your firewalls are opened (if aws its security groups, if gcp its firewalls)
It will ask for userid/passwd.
By default sonarqube has created as userid as admin and password as admin
Popup appears to change the password. Do change it and makesure u remember the password, as its difficult to get it back.
